## linking files
If you use Linux (or computers) for any reasonable length of time to do any real work, you will eventually run into some variant of the following situation: you want two programs to access the same data, but the programs expect that data to be in two different locations. Luckily, Linux provides a solution to this quandary: links.

Links come in two flavors: hard and soft (also known as symbolic) links. We'll differentiate the two with an analogy:

A hard link is when you address your apartment using multiple addresses that all lead directly to the same place (e.g., Apt 2 vs Unit 2).
A soft link is when you move apartments and have the postal service automatically forward your mail from your old place to your new place.
In a filesystem, a file is, conceptually, an address at which the contents of that file live. A hard link is an alternate address that indexes that data --- accesses to the hard link and accesses to the original file are completely identical, in that they immediately yield the necessary data. A soft/symbolic link, instead, contains the original file name. When you access the symbolic link, Linux will realize that it is a symbolic link, read the original file name, and then (typically) automatically access that file. In most cases, both situations result in accessing the original data, but the mechanisms are different.

Hard links sound simpler to most people (case in point, I explained it in one sentence above, versus two for soft links), but they have various downsides and implementation gotchas that make soft/symbolic links, by far, the more popular alternative.

In this challenge, we will learn about symbolic links (also known as symlinks). Symbolic links are created with the ln command with the -s argument, like so:

hacker@dojo:~$ cat /tmp/myfile
This is my file!
hacker@dojo:~$ ln -s /tmp/myfile /home/hacker/ourfile
hacker@dojo:~$ cat ~/ourfile
This is my file!
hacker@dojo:~$
You can see that accessing the symlink results in getting the original file contents! Also, you can see the usage of ln -s. Note that the original file path comes before the link path in the command!

A symlink can be identified as such with a few methods. For example, the file command, which takes a filename and tells you what type of file it is, will recognize symlinks:

hacker@dojo:~$ file /tmp/myfile
/tmp/myfile: ASCII text
hacker@dojo:~$ file ~/ourfile
/home/hacker/ourfile: symbolic link to /tmp/myfile
hacker@dojo:~$
Okay, now you try it! In this level the flag is, as always, in /flag, but /challenge/catflag will instead read out /home/hacker/not-the-flag. Use the symlink, and fool it into giving you the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0YtJJXEPBs-NV120iAOlV_x-hHd.QX5ETN1wSM4AzNzEzW}`

Tried using  ln -s directly but it wasn't working because there was already the fake file there so, I first removed the fake file then I recreated the path using symlink but now it'll point at flag. Therefore,  now using /challenge/cat gave the flag.

```bash
hacker@commands~linking-files:~$ ln -s /flag /home/hacker/not-the-flag
ln: failed to create symbolic link '/home/hacker/not-the-flag': File exists
hacker@commands~linking-files:~$ rm /home/hacker/not-the-flag
hacker@commands~linking-files:~$ ln -s /flag /home/hacker/not-the-flag
hacker@commands~linking-files:~$ /challenge/catflag
About to read out the /home/hacker/not-the-flag file!
pwn.college{0YtJJXEPBs-NV120iAOlV_x-hHd.QX5ETN1wSM4AzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
There are two types of links i.e. hard links and soft links and learned using soft links/symbolic links also called as symlink on command line.
