# Practicing Piping

## Named pipes
ou've learned about pipes using |, and you've seen that process substitution creates temporary named pipes (like /dev/fd/63). You can also create your own persistent named pipes that stick around on the filesystem! These are called FIFOs, which stands for First (byte) In, First (byte) Out.

You create a FIFO using the mkfifo command:

hacker@dojo:~$ mkfifo my_pipe
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l my_pipe
prw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker 0 Jan 1 12:00 my_pipe
-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker 0 Jan 1 12:00 some_file
hacker@dojo:~$
Notice the p at the beginning of the permissions - that indicates it's a pipe! That's markedly different than the - that's at the beginning of normal files, such as some_file in the above example.

Unlike the automatic named pipes from process substitution:

You control where FIFOs are created
They persist until you delete them
Any process can write to them by path (e.g., echo hi > my_pipe)
You can see them with ls and examine them like files
One problem with FIFOs is that they'll "block" any operations on them until both the read side of the pipe and the write side of the pipe are ready. For example, consider this:

hacker@dojo:~$ mkfifo myfifo
hacker@dojo:~$ echo pwn > myfifo
To service echo pwn > myfifo, bash will open the myfifo file in write mode. However, this operation will hang until something also opens the file in read mode (thus completing the pipe). That can be in a different console:

hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfifo
pwn
hacker@dojo:~$
What happened here? When we ran cat myfifo, the pipe had both sides of the connection all set, and unblocked, allowing echo pwn > myfifo to run, which sent pwn into the pipe, where it was read by cat.

Of course, this can somewhat be done by normal files: you've learned how to echo stuff into them and cat them out. Why use a FIFO instead? Here are key differences:

No disk storage: FIFOs pass data directly between processes in memory - nothing is saved to disk
Ephemeral data: Once data is read from a FIFO, it's gone (unlike files where data persists)
Automatic synchronization: Writers block until the readers are ready, and vice-versa. This is actually useful! It provides automatic synchronization. Consider the example above: with a FIFO, it doesn't matter if cat myfifo or echo pwn > myfifo is executed first; each would just wait for the other. With files, you need to make sure to execute the writer before the reader.
Complex data flows: FIFOs are useful for facilitating complex data flows, merging and splitting data in flexible ways, and so on. For example, FIFOs support multiple readers and writers.
This challenge will be a simple introduction to FIFOs. You'll need to create a /tmp/flag_fifo file and redirect the stdout of /challenge/run to it. If you're successful, /challenge/run will write the flag into the FIFO! Go do it!

HINT: The blocking behavior of FIFOs makes it hard to solve this challenge in a single terminal. You may want to use the Desktop or VSCode mode for this challenge so that you can launch two terminals.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cRaQ6CtNPID_M74_EPf9HLJq4-W.01MzMDOxwSM4AzNzEzW}`

Since fifo only works when both read and write sides are defined so that they can be piped so, first I wrote /challenge/run to fifo file and then read it in the other terminal to get the flag.

```bash
ubuntu terminal:
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ mkfifo /tmp/flag_fifo
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/flag_fifo
You're successfully redirecting /challenge/run to a FIFO at /tmp/flag_fifo!
Bash will now try to open the FIFO for writing, to pass it as the stdout of
/challenge/run. Recall that operations on FIFOs will *block* until both the
read side and the write side is open, so /challenge/run will not actually be
launched until you start reading from the FIFO!

pwn college terminal: 
cat /tmp/flag_fifo
You've correctly redirected /challenge/run's stdout to a FIFO at 
/tmp/flag_fifo! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cRaQ6CtNPID_M74_EPf9HLJq4-W.01MzMDOxwSM4AzNzEzW}
```
