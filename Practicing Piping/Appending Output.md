# Practicing Piping

## Appending Output
A common use-case of output redirection is to save off some command results for later analysis. Often times, you want to do this in aggregate: run a bunch of commands, save their output, and grep through it later. In this case, you might want all that output to keep appending to the same file, but > will create a new output file every time, deleting the old contents.

You can redirect input in append mode using >> instead of >, as so:

hacker@dojo:~$ echo pwn > outfile
hacker@dojo:~$ echo college >> outfile
hacker@dojo:~$ cat outfile
pwn
college
hacker@dojo:$
To practice, run /challenge/run with an append-mode redirect of the output to the file /home/hacker/the-flag. The practice will write the first half of the flag to the file, and the second half to stdout if stdout is redirected to the file. If you properly redirect in append-mode, the second half will be appended to the first, but if you redirect in truncation mode (>), the second half will overwrite the first and you won't get the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{04_fF_ngmRIupTJmoKiA1sy1j2d.QX3ATO0wSM4AzNzEzW}`

Used >> to append the file with second part of the flag because > overwrites the file so first part of the flag would've been deleted.

```bash
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ /challenge/run >> /home/hacker/the-flag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /home/hacker/the-flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] Good luck!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /home/hacker/the-flag. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
I will write the flag in two parts to the file /home/hacker/the-flag! I'll do
the first write directly to the file, and the second write, I'll do to stdout
(if it's pointing at the file). If you redirect the output in append mode, the
second write will append to (rather than overwrite) the first write, and you'll
get the whole flag!
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ cat /home/hacker/the-flag
 |
\|/ This is the first half:
 v
pwn.college{04_fF_ngmRIupTJmoKiA1sy1j2d.QX3ATO0wSM4AzNzEzW}
                              ^
     that is the second half /|\
                              |

If you only see the second half above, you redirected in *truncate* mode (>)
rather than *append* mode (>>), and so the write of the second half to stdout
overwrote the initial write of the first half directly to the file. Try append
mode!
