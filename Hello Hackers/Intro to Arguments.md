# Hello Hackers

## Intro to Arguments
In this challenege we learned about a command with arguments, which is what we call additional data passed to the command. When we type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses our input into a command and its arguments. The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments.

Then one example was given in which when we write 'echo hello' , we get the output hello. So, in this writeup 'echo' is command and 'hello' is arguement and 'hello' is printed as the output of the above command.

Similarly we were asked to use 'hello' as command and 'hackers'
as argument to get the flag.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ktO7qVO1kNreu17x0oPL-eVS0UT.QX4YjM1wSM4AzNzEzW}`

It was asked to write 'hello' as command and 'hackers' as argument to get the flag so, I wrote 'hello hackers' and got the flag.

```bash
hello hackers
pwn.college{ktO7qVO1kNreu17x0oPL-eVS0UT.QX4YjM1wSM4AzNzEzW}
```
