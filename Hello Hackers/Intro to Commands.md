# Hello Hackers

## Intro to Commands
Here, the we executed the whoami command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal.
Next we were asked to invoke the hello command to get the flag. So when I typed hello command I got the flag.
Also it was mentioned that Linux commands are case sensitive so, it should only be 'hello' not 'HELLO'.


### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YBbpNnZG406eUrIh30QmQD8p9av.QX3YjM1wSM4AzNzEzW}`

I was asked to invoke the 'hello' command to get the flag so I just typed 'hello' and got the flag.

```bash
hello
pwn.college{YBbpNnZG406eUrIh30QmQD8p9av.QX3YjM1wSM4AzNzEzW}
```
