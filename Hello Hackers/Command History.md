## Command History
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0tb7_9ZYN8QWiNQBGluj0gepr8l.0lNzEzNxwSM4AzNzEzW}`

It was written that typing so many commands again and again can be annoying so command history can be used to access previous command and we had to use the up arrow in the terminal to get the flag from the command history which I got.

```bash
No command (only up arrow used to access hsitory)
pwn.college{0tb7_9ZYN8QWiNQBGluj0gepr8l.0lNzEzNxwSM4AzNzEzW}
```
