## Tab Completion on Commands
Tab completion is for more than files! You can also tab-complete commands. This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag. Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kKvFuC-cSB46yefjss_Q5uSl7kf.0VN0EzNxwSM4AzNzEzW}`

hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-3251

pwn.college{kKvFuC-cSB46yefjss_Q5uSl7kf.0VN0EzNxwSM4AzNzEzW}
```
